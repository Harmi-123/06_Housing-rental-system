                    Housing has a focal significance to personal satisfaction with extensive financial, social, cultural
                    and individual significance. In spite of the fact that a nation's national prosperity is usually
                    measured in economic terms, increasing wealth is of diminished value unless all can share its
                    benefits and if the growing wealth is not used to redress growing social deficiencies, one of which
                    is housing. Housing assumes a tremendous part in rejuvenating monetary development in any nation,
                    with safe house being among key markers of improvement.

                    “The universal declaration of human rights gives one of the basic human rights as the right to a
                    decent standard of living, central to which is the access to adequate housing” (United Nations, The
                    Human Rights-article 25, 1948).

                    “Housing as a basic human right demands that urban dwellers should have access to a decent housing,
                    defined as one that provides a foundation for rather than being a barrier to good physical and
                    mental health, personal development and fulfillment of life objectives” (Seedhouse, 1986).

                    The concentration of this exploration venture is essentially overseeing lodging for low pay, medium
                    and high wages families or what is normally known as moderate lodging. „Affordable‟ is a term used
                    to depict individuals‟ ability to pay for specific items or administrations in light of the fact
                    that their wage is sufficient to do as such. In spite of the fact that the term „affordable housing‟
                    is frequently connected to rental lodging; that is inside the monetary methods for those in the
                    lower pay scopes of a topographical range, the idea is pertinent to both center and high salary
                    people. Most families lease houses in view of their salary and family circumstances; lamentably,
                    there may not be sufficient great quality rental lodging for these families.
